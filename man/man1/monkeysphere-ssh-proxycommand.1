.SH NAME

monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand \- MonkeySphere ssh ProxyCommand script

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmonkeysphere-ssh-proxy\fP is an ssh proxy command that can be used
to trigger a monkeysphere update of the known_hosts file for the hosts
that are being connected to.  It is meant to be run as an ssh
ProxyCommand.  This can either be done by specifying the proxy command
on the command line:

.B ssh -o ProxyCommand="monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand %h %p" ...

or by adding the following line to your ~/.ssh/config script:

.B ProxyCommand monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand %h %p

The script is very simple, and can easily be incorporated into other
ProxyCommand scripts.  It first tests to see if the host is in the
known_hosts file.  If it's not, the CHECK_KEYSERVER variable is set to
true and "update-known_hosts" is run for the host to check for a host
key for that host.  If the host is found in the known_hosts file,
CHECK_KEYSERVER is set to false and "update-known_hosts" is run to
update from the local keychain.

Run the following command for more info:

.B less $(which monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand)
