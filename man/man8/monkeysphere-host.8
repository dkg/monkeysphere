.TH MONKEYSPHERE-SERVER "8" "June 2008" "monkeysphere" "User Commands"

.SH NAME

monkeysphere-host \- Monkeysphere host admin tool.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B monkeysphere-host \fIsubcommand\fP [\fIargs\fP]
.br
.B monkeysphere-host expert \fIexpert-subcommand\fP [\fIargs\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBMonkeysphere\fP is a framework to leverage the OpenPGP web of trust
for OpenSSH authentication.  OpenPGP keys are tracked via GnuPG, and
added to the authorized_keys and known_hosts files used by OpenSSH for
connection authentication.

\fBmonkeysphere-host\fP is a Monkeysphere server admin utility.

.SH SUBCOMMANDS

\fBmonkeysphere-host\fP takes various subcommands:
.TP
.B show-key
Output information about host's OpenPGP and SSH keys.  `s' may be used
in place of `show-key'.
.TP
.B extend-key EXPIRE
Extend the validity of the OpenPGP key for the host until EXPIRE from
the present.  If EXPIRE is not specified, then the user will be
prompted for the extension term.  Expiration is specified like GnuPG
does:
.nf
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
.fi
`e' may be used in place of `extend-key'.
.TP
.B add-hostname HOSTNAME
Add a hostname user ID to the server host key.  `n+' may be used in
place of `add-hostname'.
.TP
.B revoke-hostname HOSTNAME
Revoke a hostname user ID from the server host key.  `n-' may be used
in place of `revoke-hostname'.
.TP
.B add-revoker FINGERPRINT
Add a revoker to the host's OpenPGP key.  `o' may be be used in place
of `add-revoker'.
.TP
.B revoke-key
Revoke the host's OpenPGP key.  `r' may be used in place of
`revoke-key'.
.TP
.B publish-key
Publish the host's OpenPGP key to the keyserver.  `p' may be used in
place of `publish-key'.
.TP
.B help
Output a brief usage summary.  `h' or `?' may be used in place of
`help'.
.TP
.B version
show version number

.SH "EXPERT" SUBCOMMANDS

Some commands are very unlikely to be needed by most administrators.
These commands must prefaced by the word `expert'.
.TP
.B gen-key [HOSTNAME]
Generate a OpenPGP key for the host.  If HOSTNAME is not specified,
then the system fully-qualified domain name will be user.  An
alternate key bit length can be specified with the `-l' or `--length'
option (default 2048).  An expiration length can be specified with the
`-e' or `--expire' option (prompt otherwise).  The expiration format
is the same as that of \fBextend-key\fP, below.  `g' may be used in
place of `gen-key'.
.TP
.B import-key
FIXME:
  import-key (i)                     import existing ssh key to gpg
   --hostname (-h) NAME[:PORT]         hostname for key user ID
   --keyfile (-f) FILE                 key file to import
   --expire (-e) EXPIRE                date to expire
.TP
.B diagnostics
Review the state of the monkeysphere server host key and report on
suggested changes.  Among other checks, this includes making sure
there is a valid host key, that the key is published, that the sshd
configuration points to the right place, etc.  `d' may be used in
place of `diagnostics'.

.SH SETUP HOST AUTHENTICATION

To enable host verification via the monkeysphere, the host's key must
be published to the Web of Trust.  This is not done by default.  To
publish the host key to the keyservers, run the following command:

$ monkeysphere-host publish-key

You must also modify the sshd_config on the server to tell sshd where
the new server host key is located:

HostKey /var/lib/monkeysphere/host/ssh_host_rsa_key

In order for users logging into the system to be able to identify the
host via the monkeysphere, at least one person (e.g. a server admin)
will need to sign the host's key.  This is done using standard OpenPGP
keysigning techniques, usually: pull the key from the keyserver,
verify and sign the key, and then re-publish the signature.  Once an
admin's signature is published, users logging into the host can use it
to validate the host's key.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables will override those specified in
the config file (defaults in parentheses):
.TP
MONKEYSPHERE_LOG_LEVEL
Set the log level (INFO).  Can be SILENT, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, in
increasing order of verbosity.
.TP
MONKEYSPHERE_KEYSERVER
OpenPGP keyserver to use (pool.sks-keyservers.net).

.SH FILES

.TP
/etc/monkeysphere/monkeysphere-host.conf
System monkeysphere-host config file.
.TP
/var/lib/monkeysphere/host/ssh_host_rsa_key
Copy of the host's private key in ssh format, suitable for use by
sshd.
