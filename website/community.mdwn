## Mailing list ##

The Monkeysphere project is a new project with just one mailing list
at the moment. Its where we roll our sphere, discuss development
issues, the project, and various complicated conundrums involving
subjects around the web of trust.

[Join us](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/monkeysphere), we're a
friendly bunch. You can also [look through our
archives](https://lists.riseup.net/www/arc/monkeysphere) if you don't
believe us.

## Development ##

The Monkeysphere uses a distributed development model with
[git](http://git.or.cz/).  Once you've [installed
git](http://www.spheredev.org/wiki/Git_for_the_lazy), you can [git
clone](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-clone.html)
from this web site:

	git clone git://git.monkeysphere.info/monkeysphere
