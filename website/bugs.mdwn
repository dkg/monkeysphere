# Bugs #

The Monkeysphere is moving to a [new issue tracking
system](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/show/monkeysphere),
hosted at [Riseup Labs](https://labs.riseup.net/code).  We're leaving
this old bug list up during the transition.

If you use [Debian](htt[://debian.org), please consider submitting
your bug to the [Debian BTS](http://bugs.debian.org/monkeysphere).

You can also browse our [completed bugs](done).

Please feel free to also ask any questions on the [the monkeysphere
mailing list](/community).
