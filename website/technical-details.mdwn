## Host key verification ##

When an ssh connection is initiated, the ssh client checks that the
host key presented by the server matches one found in the connecting
user's `known_hosts` file.  If so, the ssh client allows the
connection to continue.  If not, the client asks the user if they
would like to accept the host key for future session by asking the
user to verify the host key's fingerprint.

### Adding a server to the monkeysphere ###

Servers are "monkeysphere enabled" by generating an OpenPGP
authentication key for the server, translating the key into on ssh
key, and publishing the host key to the Web of Trust.
