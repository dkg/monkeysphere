# Validation Agent Protocol #

In its current form, the
[Monkeysphere Validation Agent](/validation-agent) is conceived of as
a minimalistic HTTP server that accepts two different requests:

 GET /  -- initial contact query, protocol version compatibility.
  (no query parameters)
  (returns: protoversion, server, available)

 POST /reviewcert  -- request validation of a certificate
  (query parameters: uid, context, pkc)
  (returns: valid, message)

Query parameters are posted as a JSON blob (*not* as
www-form-encoded).

The variables that are returned are application/json as well.

* PKC means: public key carrier: raw key, OpenPGP cert, or X.509 cert
* UID means: User ID (like in OpenPGP)
* context refers to the setting in which the certificate is offered.  For example, "https" means: "this certificate was offered by an HTTPS server"
