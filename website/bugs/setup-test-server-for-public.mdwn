[[meta title="Setup test public server/gpg key"]]

It would be really useful for people trying out the monkeysphere to be able to
test it with a participating server as soon as they've finished setting things
up. Minimally - just testing the acceptance of the server's identity would be
great.

I guess we don't really want to use george for this purpose?  Does
someone have a spare virtual machine that we could use for this
purpose?  The test machine wouldn't actually have to do any user
authentication, I guess.
