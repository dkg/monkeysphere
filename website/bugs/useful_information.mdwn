I would like to know, at INFO (default) log level, when the 
monkeyspehere makes a "real" modification to my known_hosts file; that 
is, when it adds or deletes a key.

Apparently this is hard because monkeysphere is currently configured to 
delete all keys and then add good keys, so a key added for the first 
time seems to the monkeysphere very similar to a key re-added ten 
seconds after last login.

Still, from a UI perspective, I want to know what monkeysphere is doing.
