[[meta title="Problems with root-owned gpg keyrings"]]

`/var/lib/monkeysphere/gnupg-host/` is root-owned, and the public
keyring in that directory is controlled by the superuser.

We currently expect the `monkeysphere` user to read from (but not
write to) that keyring.  But using a keyring in a directory that you
don't control appears to trigger [a subtle bug in
gpg](http://bugs.debian.org/361539) that has been unresolved for quite
a long time.

With some of the new error checking i'm doing in
`monkeysphere-server`, typical operations that involve both keyrings
as the non-privileged user can fail with an error message like:

    gpg: failed to rebuild keyring cache: file open error

Running the relevant operation a second time as the same user usually
lets things go through without a failure, but this seems like it would
be hiding a bug, rather than getting it fixed correctly.

Are there other ways we can deal with this problem?
