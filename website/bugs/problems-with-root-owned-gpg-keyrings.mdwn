[[meta title="Problems with root-owned gpg keyrings"]]

`/var/lib/monkeysphere/gnupg-host/` is root-owned, and the public
keyring in that directory is controlled by the superuser.

We currently expect the `monkeysphere` user to read from (but not
write to) that keyring.  But using a keyring in a directory that you
don't control appears to trigger [a subtle bug in
gpg](http://bugs.debian.org/361539) that has been unresolved for quite
a long time.

With some of the new error checking i'm doing in
`monkeysphere-server`, typical operations that involve both keyrings
as the non-privileged user can fail with an error message like:

    gpg: failed to rebuild keyring cache: file open error

Running the relevant operation a second time as the same user usually
lets things go through without a failure, but this seems like it would
be hiding a bug, rather than getting it fixed correctly.

Are there other ways we can deal with this problem?

--dkg

Here is an example when using monkeysphere-server
add-identity-certifier on a host with a newly-installed monkeysphere
installaton.  Note that running the same command a second time works
as expected:

     This key is due to expire on 2012-05-31.
     Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
     (by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

       1 = I trust marginally
       2 = I trust fully


     Please enter the depth of this trust signature.
     A depth greater than 1 allows the key you are signing to make
     trust signatures on your behalf.


     Please enter a domain to restrict this signature, or enter for none.


     Are you sure that you want to sign this key with your
     key "ssh://pip.fifthhorseman.net" (9B83C17D)

     The signature will be marked as non-exportable.
