[[meta title="revoke-hostname function revokes wrong hostname user ID"]]

It appears that the monkeysphere-server revoke-hostname function will
occasionaly revoke the wrong hostname.  I say occasionally, but it
seems to be doing it pretty consistently for me at the moment:
        
	servo:~ 0$ sudo monkeysphere-server n- servo.finestructure.net
	The following host key user ID will be revoked:
	  ssh://servo.finestructure.net
	Are you sure you would like to revoke this user ID? (y/N) y

	Please select the reason for the revocation:
	  0 = No reason specified
	  4 = User ID is no longer valid
	  Q = Cancel
	(Probably you want to select 4 here)
	Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:

Clearly this is unacceptable.  gpg does not let you can't specify a
uid to revoke from the command line.  The uid revokation can only be
done through edit-key.  We do edit-key scripting in other contexts,
but to revoke a user id you have to specify the uid by "number".  We
currently try to guess the number from the ordering of the output of
list-key.  However, this output does not appear to coincide with the
ordering in edit-key.  I don't have a good solution or fix at the
moment.  Suggestions are most welcome.  It may just require some trial
and error with edit-key to come up with something workable.

This underlines the problem that gpg is currently not very well suited
for manipulating gpg keyrings non-interactively.  It's possible that I
just haven't figured out how to do it yet, but it's not very clear if
it is possible.  It would be nice to have some alternate tools to use.
