It would be nice to make all of the Monkeysphere scripts POSIX
compliant, for portability and light-weightedness.  Better POSIX
compliance would probably at least be better for compatibility with
o{ther,lder} versions of bash.  Unfortunately there are quite a few
bashism at the moment, so this may not be trivial.  For instance:

      servo:~/cmrg/monkeysphere/git 0$ checkbashisms -f src/monkeysphere-server 2>&1 | wc -l
      50
      servo:~/cmrg/monkeysphere/git 0$
