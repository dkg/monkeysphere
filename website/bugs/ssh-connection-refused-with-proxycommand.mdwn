I added the following to my .ssh/config:

Host *
ProxyCommand monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand %h %p

So that the monkeysphere would be used for all my connections.

However, I can no longer connect to any hosts. Here's example out put:

		0 jamie@liberace:bugs$ ssh root@chavez.mayfirst.org
		ms: processing host: chavez.mayfirst.org
		ms:   - key not found.
		ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
		255 jamie@liberace:bugs$

The server auth.log has nothing in it.
