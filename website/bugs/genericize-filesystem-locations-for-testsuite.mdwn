[[meta title="genericize all filesystem locations to enable test suite:" ]]

I'm in the process of writing a testsuite for the monkeysphere so that
we can verify that it actually performs all the basic expected duties
properly.

It occurs to me that lines like these:

    ETC="/etc/monkeysphere"
    VARLIB="/var/lib/monkeysphere"

Actually make it very difficult to generically test the tool without
it being installed system-wide.

Is there any reason that we should not allow these directories to be
overridden with environment variables in the same way that
`/usr/share/monkeysphere/share` is handled?

    SHARE=${MONKEYSPHERE_SHARE:-"/usr/share/monkeysphere"}

I guess i'm proposing something like:

    SYSCONFIGDIR=${MONKEYSPHERE_SYSCONFIGDIR:-"/etc/monkeysphere"}
    SYSDATADIR=${MONKEYSPHERE_SYSDATADIR:-"/var/lib/monkeysphere"}

Thoughts?
