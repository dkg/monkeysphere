[[!meta title="`monkeysphere gen-key` should guess at KeyID if none provided"]]

Currently, if you have a single private key in your GnuPG keyring, and
you call:

	monkeysphere gen-key

(with no additional arguments), it will report an error.

It would be more user-friendly if we could guess which key to use.  I
suggest:

* If the user only has no GPG secret keys at all, it should fail, and
  suggest that the user create a key first, then re-run `monkeysphere
  gen-key`.  (`monkeysphere` could actually invoke `gpg --gen-key` for
  the user directly, if the user wants that)

* If the user only has one GPG secret key, it should use that key.

* If the user has more than one GPG secret key, `monkeysphere` should
  fail, and report the different key IDs that they user might want to
  select (reporting which keys already have authorization subkeys or
  the authorization capability on the primary key would be useful too)
