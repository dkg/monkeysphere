In `~/.ssh/config`, i have:

	HashKnownHosts No

But when `monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand` adds new hosts to
`~/.ssh/known_hosts`, they appear to be added in a hashed form,
instead of in the clear.

fwiw: i'm using OpenSSH 5.1p1 on a debian lenny system (backported
from sid)

I can confirm this too (I'm running openssh-client 1:4.7p1-12)

There is absolutely no attempt by any monkeysphere utility to parse
any ssh or sshd config file.  This will probably need to be delt with
down the line, but it's not a particular easy task at the moment.
