[[meta title="users with missing or empty authorized keys and User IDs should have MS-generated keys cleared" ]]

I had a user who had a bunch of entries in
`~/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids`, and a bunch of raw keys in
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.  My system's `monkeysphere-server` handled
this situation appropriately, and populated
`/var/lib/monkeysphere/authorized_keys/user` with the full set.

Then i wanted to wipe out all key entries for that user.  So i did:

	mkdir ~user/backup
	mv ~user/.ssh ~user/.monkeysphere ~user/backup
	monkeysphere-server update-users user

I expected this to either remove
`/var/lib/monkeysphere/authorized_keys/user`, or truncate it to 0
bytes.  However, it just remained untouched, and the old keys
persisted.

This seems like a potential security problem.
