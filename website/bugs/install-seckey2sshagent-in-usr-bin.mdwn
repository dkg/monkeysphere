[[meta title="Install seckey2sshagent in /usr/bin/"]]

I know it's a hack - but installing seckey2sshagent in /usr/bin/ would make it
much easier for people to use.

I'm not sure I really want to include this hack with the debs.  It's really not useful for any kind of regular use.  I would rather focus on getting openpgp2ssh to support passprotected keys.

As another possibility, I was planning on modifying the script so that it could export to a passprotected file.  I think this would be a lot more useful.  Let me get that working, then let's revist the issue of including it in the packaging.
