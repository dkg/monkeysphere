[[meta title="Monkeysphere support for options in authorized_keys"]]

OpenSSH [allows users to control the capabilities granted to remote
key-based
logins](http://www.hackinglinuxexposed.com/articles/20030109.html) by
supplying options that should limit the use of the key.

For example, specifying `no-pty` means that `sshd` should not allocate
a pseudo-terminal for sessions created based on an authentication with
that key.

It is unclear if it is possible to do this sort of limiting in
`~/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids`, and if it is possible, how
you'd actually do it.
