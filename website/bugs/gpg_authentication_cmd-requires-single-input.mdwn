In monkeysphere-server, the gpg\_authentication function, and
consequently the gpg\_authentication\_cmd, currently requires that all
arguments be put in a single quoted argument, eg:

	      gpg_authentication "--list-key --with-colons --with-fingerprint 0x${keyID}!"

This is obviously a little lame, but it seems to be necessary to do
the necessary argument passing from the function, to the su function
called as the monkeysphere user that controls the gpg authentication
keyring.

I'm not sure how to fix it.  I think the problem is mostly in how
arguments are passed to su.
