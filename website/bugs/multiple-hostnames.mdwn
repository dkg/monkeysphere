[[meta title="Support multiple host names for monkeysphere-enabled servers"]]

Some monkeysphere-enabled hosts answer to multiple host names, but the
current `monkeysphere-server` only generates a single User ID
corresponding to a single hostname.

We should make it easier for machines with multiple names to create
multiple User IDs at `gen-key` time.

We should also make it easy to add new hostnames (and remove outdated
ones).

For example: `george.riseup.net` is now also known as
`monkeysphere.info`.  It'd be nice to have a convenient way to add
that hostname to the key without mucking around with gpg directly.

So how do we imagine the behavior here?  I assume that basically it
would just add/remove user ID's to/from the host key locally.  I guess
we will continue to rely on the "publish-key" subcommand to actually
publish all changes to the keys.
