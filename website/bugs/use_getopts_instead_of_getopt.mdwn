Since Monkeysphere is using bash, it would be nice to use the shell
build in getopts function, instead of the external getopt program.
This would reduce an external dependency, which would definitely be
better for portability.

So it looks like the sh built-in getopts does not include long options
(eg. "--expire").  Is it worth getting rid of the long options for
this?

---

Why not just get rid of getopts altogether and perform a simple
argument-processing loop with bash string tests?  We're only invoking
getopt in three places, and each invocation is no more complex than
three arguments -- and most arguments take a separate parameter, which
means that handling tricky arg blobs like -aCxr are not gonna be
supported anyway.
