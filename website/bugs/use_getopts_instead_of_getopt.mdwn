Since Monkeysphere is using bash, it would be nice to use the shell
build in getopts function, instead of the external getopt program.
This would reduce an external dependency, which would definitely be
better for portability.

So it looks like the sh built-in getopts does not include long options
(eg. "--expire").  Is it worth getting rid of the long options for
this?
