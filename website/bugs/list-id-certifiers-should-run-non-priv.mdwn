[[meta title="list-identity-certfiers should run as the non-privileged user"]]

Right now, `monkeysphere-server list-identity-certifiers` runs as the
superuser, and just lists the keys in the host's keyring.  This might
not be the actual list of valid id certifiers, for a number of reasons:

* the keys themselves might have been revoked by the owner

* the id-certifiers might have been added with a different trust
  level, or a regexp/domain limitation.

It would make more sense to derive the list of trusted certifiers
directly from the keyrings as seen by the non-privileged
`monkeysphere` user, since this user's keyrings are what are going to
judge the validity of various user IDs.
