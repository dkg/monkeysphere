[[ meta title="make tarball is not idempotent" ]]

The current monkeysphere Makefile has a "tarball" target, which
produces the "upstream tarball".  Unfortunately, it is not idempotent.
That is, if you run it twice in a row (without changing any other
source), the second .orig.tar.gz file is bytewise different from the
first.

We should fix this so that the tarball generated is the same at least
as long as no local file has been touched.
