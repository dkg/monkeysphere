I would like to know, at INFO (default) log level, when the 
monkeyspehere makes a "real" modification to my known_hosts file; that 
is, when it adds or deletes a key.

Apparently this is hard because monkeysphere is currently configured to 
delete all keys and then add good keys, so a key added for the first 
time seems to the monkeysphere very similar to a key re-added ten 
seconds after last login.

Still, from a UI perspective, I want to know what monkeysphere is doing.

------

It looks like jrollins committed a change for reporting at INFO level
when a host key gets added by the monkeysphere:
2459fa3ea277d7b9289945748619eab1e3441e5c

When i connect to a host whose key is not already present in my
known_hosts file, i get the following to stderr:

    ms: * new key for squeak.fifthhorseman.net added to known_hosts file.

This doesn't fully close this bug, because we aren't notifying on key
deletion, afaict.
