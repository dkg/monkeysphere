[[meta title="Reorganize monkeysphere-server shortcuts"]]

Currently, `monkeysphere-server` supports three subcommands to adjust
the "identity certifiers":

* `add-identity-certifier` (`a`)
* `remove-identity-certifier` (`r`)
* `list-identity-certifier` (`l`)

Since [we also want to be able to add/remove multiple
hostnames](multiple-hostnames), i think we should change the shortcuts
from `a`, `r`, and `l` to `c+`, `c-`, and `c`.

This would let us create new subcommands like:

* `add-host-name` (`n+`)
* `revoke-host-name` (`n-`)
* `list-host-names` (`n`)
