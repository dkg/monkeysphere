[[!meta title="debian packaging postinst script clobbers gpg.conf settings in /var/lib/monkeysphere" ]]

Do we want to allow the system administrator to make adjustments to
the `gpg.conf` config files found in `/var/lib/monkeysphere`?  At the
moment, there are two such files:

 * `/var/lib/monkeysphere/gnupg-authentication/gpg.conf`
 * `/var/lib/monkeysphere/gnupg-host/gpg.conf`

In the debian postinst scripts (`debian/monkeysphere.postinst`), the
contents of those files are overwritten on every upgrade/reinstall,
effectively clobbering any changes made by the local admin.

Maybe we *do* want to do this clobbering, though.  Stuff in `/var` is
generally not expected to be modified by hand.  I see two possible
resolutions to this:

 * when we clobber those files, include a comment along the lines of:
    # do not make changes to this file!  It is overwritten on each upgrade!

 * Avoid clobbering the files, and treat them as config files.

the latter approach suggests that they should be more properly stored
in `/etc/`, though.  This would give us all the conf-file tracking
apparatus, which is nice.  If we do want to do that, I guess we'd
symlink to them from the monkeysphere-specific `$GNUPGHOME`s in
`/var/lib/monkeysphere`, since `gpg` does not seem to allow for
overriding the location of the `gpg.conf` independent of `$GNUPGHOME`.

---

All the gpg.conf files now reside in /etc/monkeysphere, and are linked
in into the GNUPGHOMEs in /var/lib/monkeysphere.
