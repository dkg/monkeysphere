[[meta title="Monkeysphere should consult keyserver setting in gpg.conf"]]

Currently, monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand checks the following places to
determine which keyserver to use (in order of priority):

 * environment variable (MONKEYSPHERE_KEYSERVER)
 * KEYSERVER variable in ~/.monkeysphere/monkeysphere.conf
 * default value of subkeys.pgp.net

It would be useful if monkeysphere also consulted ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf, using the
following order instead:

 * environment variable (MONKEYSPHERE_KEYSERVER)
 * KEYSERVER variable in ~/.monkeysphere/monkeysphere.conf
 * keyserver variable in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
 * default value of subkeys.pgp.net
