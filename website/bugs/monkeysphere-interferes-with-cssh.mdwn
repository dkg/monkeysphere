[[meta title="Monkeysphere interferes with clusterssh"]]

clusterssh is a package that allows you to control multiple ssh xterm
sessions at the same time.

When the monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand is enabled and I launch 5 or more
cssh sessions, intermittently one or two out of every five will fail
with: Connection timed out during banner exchange.

I tried to debug by running:

    MONKEYSPHERE_LOG_LEVEL=debug cssh -D -d <server1> <server2> etc.

However, while it produced some private data, it didn't give me any
insight into what was going wrong. Also, it didn't output any
Monkeysphere debugging info.

I had no luck with google and the error message being output.

This isn't a huge priority (it's not hard to disable the
monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand before running cssh), however, it would be
nice to figure out why it's not working.
