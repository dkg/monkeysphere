[[meta title="monkeysphere-server publish-key does not work"]]

Currently, if you try to run `monkeysphere-server publish-key`, you
can get the following output:

	Really publish key to subkeys.pgp.net? (y/N) y
	NOT PUBLISHED (to avoid permanent publication errors during monkeysphere development).
	The following command should publish the key:
	monkeysphere-server gpg-authentication-cmd '--keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --send-keys foo.example.org'

I think we've demonstrated that this system works enough to warrant
using the public keyserver infrastructure.

I suggest that we should actually enable this feature explicitly.
(leaving in the prompt is fine, though it would be nice to be able to
`--force` it or something).
