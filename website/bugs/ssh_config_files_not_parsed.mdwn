In `~/.ssh/config`, i have:

	HashKnownHosts No

But when `monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand` adds new hosts to
`~/.ssh/known_hosts`, they appear to be added in a hashed form,
instead of in the clear.

fwiw: i'm using OpenSSH 5.1p1 on a debian lenny system (backported
from sid)

I can confirm this too (I'm running openssh-client 1:4.7p1-12)

There is absolutely no attempt by any monkeysphere utility to parse
any ssh or sshd config file.  This will probably need to be delt with
down the line, but it's not a particular easy task at the moment.

I've [posted to the `openssh-unix-dev` list to see if there is a
possibility of openssh making our lives easier
here](http://marc.info/?l=openssh-unix-dev&m=121804767122918&w=2), but
i haven't had much of a response yet.

For some reason this didn't get mentioned in this bug earlier, but
there is a monkeysphere config variable about hashing known_hosts
lines, which is set to true by default (to be in sync with the Debian
openssh-client package).

I think this bug is really more about the fact that monkeysphere does
not parse the ssh config files for any directives relavent to what the
monkeysphere is doing.  I'm changing the name of this bug to reflect
what the real issue is.
