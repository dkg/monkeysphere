I don't mind the monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand output on regular connections.

For me it looks something like this with a server not participating in the
monkey sphere:

		ms: processing host: chavez.mayfirst.org
		ms:   - key not found.
	
And like this for a server participating:

		ms: processing host: george.riseup.net
		ms:  primary key found: 7353A74E3B757F8C
		ms:   * acceptable key found.
		ms: known_hosts file updated.

However, I have some batch scripts that run ssh that also provide output, so the monkeysphere output clutters things up.

I would really like to either have a -q/--quiet option, or, preferable for me
at least, would be for silent output to be the default and have a -v/--verbose
option to get the output. Or - maybe these should be environmental variables?
In any event - someway to suppress informational output would be a useful
improvement.

------

I'd be fine with silent mode as a default, with a more verbose mode
accessible to the user who desires it.

I'd prefer an environment variable (e.g. `MONKEYSPHERE_VERBOSE` or
`MONKEYSPHERE_DEBUG`) over a command-line (e.g. `--verbose`) option,
personally.  It's more in keeping with the model we've used in general
so far.

------

I just completed this feature. I published it to a separate branch
(called quiet-mode). I haven't committed it to my master branch for a
couple reasons:

 * I made some significant changes and wanted to ask Big Jimmy to take a
 look since it's mostly his stuff I mucked about with.

 * Sometime between starting my hacking and mid-way through, my
 ~.ssh/known_hosts file got truncted to nothing. I recovered from a
 backup. I couldn't figure out what caused that to happen and couldn't
 replicate it. I was debugging my bash and what I was debugging involved
 bash redirection, so it's reasonable to think that something I did
 caused the problem. However, before committing we incorporate this, I
 would appreciate another set of eyes on my code to make sure I'm not
 doing something dangerous or just dumb :).

Here's an overview of what I did: 

There were two function defined in common that handle sending messages
to the user: log and loge. They both echo the argument passed to
standard error. The first one also echo's "ms: " (as a preface to the
message).  loge was only called in two places and I think is left over
cruft (let me know if I'm wrong please!). 

I've added drop in replacement functions: notice, info, and
debug. I've replaced all instances of log and loge with info. 

If you use notice, your message will always be sent to standard error.
If you use info, it will be sent to standard error if the env variable
MONKEYSPHERE_OUTPUT_QUIET is set to off (it is off by default).  If you
use debug, it will be sent to standard error only if
MONKEYSPHERE_OUTPUT_DEBUG is set to on (it's off by default). 

Lastly, in monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand, I've set
MONKEYSPHERE_QUIET_MODE to on by default. 

So the result is: when using monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand, you will not
get any output unless you set MONEKYSPHERE_OUTPUT_QUIET to off or
MONKEYSPHERE_OUTPUT_DEBUG to on. All other commands should work exactly
like they did in the past.

And... we can go through the code and change calls to the info function
to either notice (if we want them to be sent regardless of the QUIET
variable) or debug (if we want it only sent if DEBUG is set).

I'm open to suggestions, problems, etc :).
