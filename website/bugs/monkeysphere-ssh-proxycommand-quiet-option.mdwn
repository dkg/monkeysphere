I don't mind the monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand output on regular connections.

For me it looks something like this with a server not participating in the
monkey sphere:

		ms: processing host: chavez.mayfirst.org
		ms:   - key not found.
	
And like this for a server participating:

		ms: processing host: george.riseup.net
		ms:  primary key found: 7353A74E3B757F8C
		ms:   * acceptable key found.
		ms: known_hosts file updated.

However, I have some batch scripts that run ssh that also provide output, so the monkeysphere output clutters things up.

I would really like to either have a -q/--quiet option, or, preferable for me
at least, would be for silent output to be the default and have a -v/--verbose
option to get the output. Or - maybe these should be environmental variables?
In any event - someway to suppress informational output would be a useful
improvement.
