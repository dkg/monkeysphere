[[meta title="Add man pages to web site"]]

We should publish the various monkeysphere man pages in browsable form
somewhere under http://monkeysphere.info/.  Ideally, this would be
updated automatically from the sources for the official man pages
themselves.

This strikes me as an ikiwiki subproject (implementing a man2html wiki
compilation language perhaps?).

Interestingly, [ikiwiki's own man page](http://ikiwiki.info/usage/)
appears to be written in markdown and then converted to nroff.
