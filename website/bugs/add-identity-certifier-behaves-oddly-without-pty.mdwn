When executing `monkeysphere-server add-identity-certifier` across a
link without a pseudo-terminal, it behaves oddly (prompts are created
that are only halfway-readable, gpg gives error messages about lacking
access to a `/dev/tty`, etc.

You can try this directly if you have remote ssh access to the
superuser on a monkeysphere-enabled host, assuming that `$GPGID` is
set to the full fingerprint of a key you want to add as a trusted
identity certifier:

	ssh root@example.org monkeysphere-server add-identity-certifier $GPGID

Compare this behavior with:

	ssh -t root@example.org monkeysphere-server add-identity-certifier $GPGID
