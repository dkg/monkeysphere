## Downloading and Installing ##

If you are running a Debian system, you can install Monkeysphere
by following these directions:

You can add this repo to your system by putting the following lines in
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/monkeysphere.list`:

	deb http://archive.monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere
	deb-src http://archive.monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere

The repository is currently signed by [The Monkeysphere archive
signing key](/archive-key), key id EB8AF314 (fingerprint: `2E8D
D26C 53F1 197D DF40 3E61 18E6 67F1 EB8A F314`).  To cryptographically
verify the packages, you'll want to [add this key to your apt
configuration after verifying its
integrity](http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt).

Once you've installed the packages, you might want to read up on how
to get started [as a regular user](/getting-started-user) or [as a
systems administrator](/getting-started-admin).

## Enhancements ##

As of 2008-08-22, If you run debian lenny you're very close to being
able to run a fully monkeysphere-enabled system.  One gap in the
system is that lenny's GnuTLS can't support the `monkeysphere
subkey-to-ssh-agent` subcommand.

You can install a patched version of GnuTLS to enable this feature of
the MonkeySphere by adjusting the monkeysphere `sources.list` lines to
include the `gnutls` component.  So they'd look like this instead:

	deb http://archive.monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere gnutls
	deb-src http://archive.monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere gnutls

You can [read more about this offering](/news/modified-gnutls-2.4.x-available).

## Source ##

For people who can't use the debian package, or folks who just want to
look at the source, we recommend [using git](/community).

But if you want a tarball of the most recent release, we publish those
too.  The [latest
tarball](http://archive.monkeysphere.info/debian/pool/monkeysphere/m/monkeysphere/monkeysphere_0.14.orig.tar.gz)
