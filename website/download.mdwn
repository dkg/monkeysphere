## Enhancements ##

As of 2008-08-22, If you run debian lenny you're very close to being
able to run a fully monkeysphere-enabled system.  One gap in the
system is that lenny's GnuTLS can't support the `monkeysphere
subkey-to-ssh-agent` subcommand.

You can install a patched version of GnuTLS to enable this feature of
the MonkeySphere by adjusting the monkeysphere `sources.list` lines to
include the `gnutls` component.  So they'd look like this instead:

	deb http://archive.monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere gnutls
	deb-src http://archive.monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere gnutls
