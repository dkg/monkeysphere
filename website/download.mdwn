by following these directions:

You can add this repo to your system by putting the following lines in
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/monkeysphere.list:

	deb http://monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere

The repository is currently signed by [Daniel Kahn Gillmor's OpenPGP
key](http://fifthhorseman.net/dkg.gpg "dkg's key"), key id D21739E9
(fingerprint: `0EE5 BE97 9282 D80B 9F75 40F1 CCD2 ED94 D217 39E9`).
To cryptographically verify the packages, you'll want to [add `dkg`'s
key to your apt
configuration](http://cmrg.fifthhorseman.net/wiki/apt/importing-keys
"Instructions for adding dkg's key to apt")

### Enhancements ###

As of 2008-08-22, If you run debian lenny you're very close to being
able to run a fully monkeysphere-enabled system.  One gap in the
system is that lenny's GnuTLS can't support the `monkeysphere
subkey-to-ssh-agent` subcommand.

You can install a patched version of GnuTLS to enable this feature of
the MonkeySphere by adjusting the monkeysphere `sources.list` lines to
include the `gnutls` component.  So they'd look like this instead:

	deb http://monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere gnutls
	deb-src http://monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere gnutls
