The Monkeysphere project's goal is to extend the web of trust model and other
features of OpenPGP to other areas of the Internet to help us securely identify
each other while we work online.

## Conceptual overview ##

Humans (and
[monkeys](http://www.scottmccloud.com/comics/mi/mi-17/mi-17.html))
have innate capacity to keep track of the identity of a finite number
of people. After our social sphere exceeds several dozen or several
hundred (depending on the individual), our ability to remember and
distinguish people begins to break down. In other words, at a certain
point, we can't know for sure that the person we ran into in the
produce aisle really is the same person who we met at the party last
week.

For most of us, this limitation has not posed much of a problem in our daily,
off-line lives.  With the Internet, however, we have an ability to interact
with vastly larger numbers of people than we had before. In addition, on the
Internet we lose many of our tricks for remembering and identifying people
(physical characteristics, sound of the voice, etc.).

Fortunately, with online communications we have easy access to tools
that can help us navigate these problems.
[OpenPGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openpgp) (a cryptographic
protocol commonly used for sending signed and encrypted email
messagess) is one such tool. In its simplest form, it allows us to
sign our communication in such a way that the recipient can verify the
sender.

OpenPGP goes beyond this simple use to implement a feature known as the [web of
trust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust). The web of trust
allows people  who have never met in person to communicate with a reasonable
degree of certainty that they are who they say they are. It works like this:
Person A trusts Person B. Person B verifies Person C's identity.  Then, Person
A can verify Person C's identity. 

The Monkeyshpere's goal is to extend the use of OpenPGP from email
communications to other activities, such as:

 * conclusively identifying the remote server in a remote login session
 * granting access to servers to people we've never directly met

## Technical Details ##

The project's first goal is to integrate with
[http://openssh.com/](OpenSSH).

OpenSSH provides a functional way for management of explicit RSA and
DSA keys (without any type of [Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Key_Infrastructure)). The
basic idea of this project is to create a framework that uses GPG's
keyring manipulation capabilities and public keyservers to generate
files that OpenSSH will accept and handle as intended.  This offers
users of OpenSSH an effective PKI, including the possibility for key
transitions, transitive identifications, revocations, and expirations.
It also actively invites broader participation in the OpenPGP Web of
Trust.

Under the Monkeysphere, both parties to an OpenSSH connection (client
and server) have a responsibility to explicitly designate who they
trust to certify the identity of the other party.  This trust
designation is explicitly indicated with traditional GPG keyring trust
model.  No modification is made to the SSH protocol on the wire (it
continues to use raw RSA public keys), and it should work with
unpatched OpenSSH software.
