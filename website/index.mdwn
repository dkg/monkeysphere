The Monkeysphere project's goal is to extend the web of trust model and other
features of OpenPGP to other areas of the Internet to help us securely identify
each other while we work online.

##Conceptual overview##

Humans (and monkeys) have innate capacity to keep track of the identity of a
finite number of people. After our social sphere exceeds several dozen or
several hundred (depending on the individual), our ability to remember and
distinguish people begins to break down. In other words, at a certain point, we
can't know for sure that the person we ran into in the produce aisle really is
the same person who we met at the party last week.

For most of us, this limitation has not posed much of a problem in our daily,
off-line lives.  With the Internet, however, we have an ability to interact
with vastly larger numbers of people than we had before. In addition, on the
Internet we lose many of our tricks for remembering and identifying people
(physical characteristics, sound of the voice, etc.).

Fortunately, with online communications we have easy access to tools that can
help us navigate these problems.
[OpenPGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openpgp) (a protocol commonly used for
sending signed and encrypted email messagess) is one such tool. In its simplest
form, it allows us to sign our communication in such a way that the recipient
can verify the sender.

OpenPGP goes beyond this simple use to implement a feature known as the [web of
trust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openpgp#Web_of_trust). The web of trust
allows people  who have never met in person to communicate with a reasonable
degree of certainty that they are who they say they are. It works like this:
Person A trusts Person B. Person B verifies Person C's identity.  Then, Person
A can verify Person C's identity. 

The Monkeyshpere's goal is to extend the use of OpenPGP from email
communications to other activities, such as:

 * trusting the servers we login to
 * granting access to servers to people we've never met

##Technical Details##

The project's first goal is to integrate with
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openssh](OpenSSH).

OpenSSH provides a functional way for management of explicit RSA keys (without
certification of any type). The basic idea of this project is to create a
framework that uses GPG's keyring manipulation capabilities and public
keyservers to generate files that OpenSSH will accept and handle without
complaint.

Both entities in an OpenSSH connection (client and server) thus have the
responsibility to explicitly designate who they trust to "introduce" others.
They can explicitly indicate this trust relationship with traditional GPG
keyring trust indicators. No modification is made to the SSH protocol on the
wire, which continues to use raw RSA public keys.
