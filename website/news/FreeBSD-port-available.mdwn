[[!meta title="FreeBSD port available"]]

Update: [FreeBSD's official ports tree now contains monkeysphere
0.24](FreeBSD-0.24-port-accepted).

There is now a FreeBSD port available for the Monkeysphere.

It has been built and tested (so far) on a FreeBSD 7.1 AMD64 system,
installed from the [BETA2
ISOs](ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ISO-IMAGES-amd64/7.1/).  Many
thanks to [Anarcat](http://anarcat.ath.cx/pgp) for his work in pulling
this port together!

While the monkeysphere is not officially included in the ports tree
yet, [a problem
report](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=ports/128406) has
been submitted, and the package itself is functional.

The latest version of the ports directory can be found in [the git
repository](/community) under
`packaging/freebsd/security/monkeysphere`.  Please [let us
know](/community) if you encounter any problems with it on a FreeBSD
system.

If you have git installed on your FreeBSD system, you should be able
to build the latest port with:

    git clone git://git.monkeysphere.info/monkeysphere
    cp -a monkeysphere/packaging/freebsd/security/monkeysphere /usr/ports/security
    cd /usr/ports/security/monkeysphere
    make && make install

Happy Hacking!
