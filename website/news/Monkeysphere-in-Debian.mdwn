[[!meta title="Monkeysphere now in Debian!"]]

[The Monkeysphere has made it into
Debian!](http://packages.debian.org/sid/monkeysphere)

It is in Debian unstable ("sid") now, which means it won't make it
into the next stable release ("lenny"), but hopefully will make it
into the stable release after that ("squeeze").

Congratulations to all the work by all the [monkeysphere
developers](/community), and to Micah Anderson for being our Debian
sponsor.

Please feel free to start submitting bug reports to the [Debian
BTS](http://bugs.debian.org/monkeysphere).
