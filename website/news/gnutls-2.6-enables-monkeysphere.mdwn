[[!meta title="GnuTLS 2.6.x enables Monkeysphere to read authentication subkeys"]]

-----

**2009-04-05 UPDATE:** Since Monkeysphere no longer depends on GnuTLS
at all ([moved to using Perl for key
translation](news/release-0.24-1)), and GnuTLS 2.6 is now available in
Debian testing, we have removed the GnuTLS patches from the repostiory
(although they will continue to be available in the history, or
course).

-----

We [announced earlier](/news/modified-gnutls-2.4.x-available) that the
Monkeysphere project was providing patched versions of GnuTLS to
support one piece of Monkeysphere functionality.  Fortunately, those
patches are no longer needed, because as of [version
2.6](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3135),
GnuTLS contains the necessary functionality natively.

Therefore, our project will no longer provide patched copies of
GnuTLS, though we will continue to keep the patch alive in in [our git
repository](/community) until GnuTLS 2.6 has been more widely adopted.

If you were pulling patched versions of GnuTLS 2.4 from the
Monkeysphere archive, you may prefer to pull GnuTLS 2.6 from [debian's
experimental archive](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianExperimental) (at
least until it GnuTLS 2.6 drops into unstable, which should happen
shortly after the release of
[lenny](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLenny).
