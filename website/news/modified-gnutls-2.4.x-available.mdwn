[[meta title="Modified GnuTLS 2.4.x available"]]

The MonkeySphere project is now making available a patched version of
[GnuTLS](http://gnutls.org/) version 2.4.x, which enhances the utility
of the `monkeysphere` package by enabling it to read authentication
subkeys emitted by [GnuPG](http://gnupg.org/) under certain
circumstances.

You can track this package in debian lenny by adding the following
lines to `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

	deb http://monkeysphere.info/debian experimental gnutls
	deb-src http://monkeysphere.info/debian experimental gnutls

Or you can patch and build the packages yourself with the patches and
scripts provided in [the MonkeySphere git repo](/download).

The only modification needed simply enables the library to parse a GNU
extension to the String-to-key (S2K) mechanism as laid out in [RFC
4880](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-3.7).

The specific S2K extension supported is known as gnu-dummy, and it
simply allows a "secret" key block to be written *without* storing any
of the secret key material.  This is used by GnuPG on the primary key
when the `--export-secret-subkeys` argument is given.

You can read notes about the GNU S2K extensions in DETAILS from GnuPG,
which you can fetch this way:

	svn co svn://cvs.gnupg.org/gnupg/trunk/doc
	less doc/DETAILS

A version of this patch was first proposed [on
`gnutls-dev`](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2008-08/msg00005.html),
and looks like it will be adopted upstream in the GnuTLS 2.6.x series,
at which point these packages will be unnecessary.

Until that time, these packages are provided to tide over users of
`monkeysphere` on debian lenny (or compatible systems) who want to be
able to hand off the authentication-capable OpenPGP subkeys in their
GnuPG keyring to their SSH agent.
