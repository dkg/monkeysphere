# The monkeysphere has a mailing list! #

We've been working with a relatively bulky CC list since the inception
of the monkeysphere concept, but we now have a
[mailing-list!](http://lists.riseup.net/www/info/monkeysphere) It even
has [archives!](https://lists.riseup.net/www/arc/monkeysphere)

We started off with this CC list because we were interested in
exploring distributed models of collaboration, communication and
organization. Using the [git VCS](http://git.or.cz/) we were able to
set up our development infrastructure to be totally distributed, but
we soon realized that other aspects of the monkeysphere project needed
to be accessible to the public, such as a project home page (although
we could setup a system to distribute that), and a mailing list that
people other than us could join and browse the archives (we've got
some interesting ideas here too)... 

So, although our all-distributed model has cracked a bit, it's mostly
for want of tools to facilitate the process, and although we are eager
to explore the mechanisms to make these things happen, we didn't want
to keep the monkeysphere back while we did so.
