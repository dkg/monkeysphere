# MonkeySphere 0.11-1 released! #

MonkeySphere 0.11-1 has been released.  This release includes bugfixes
and a new `monkeysphere subkey-to-ssh-agent` subcommand.  

Using the new subcommand requires that your system's [GnuTLS library
can deal with the gnu-dummy S2K
extension](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2008-08/msg00005.html),
but it should fail gracefully if that's not possible.

[[download]] it now!
