[[!meta title="Monkeysphere Validation Agent (Perl) 0.2 released!"]]

Version 0.2 of the Perl implementation of the Monkeysphere Validation
Agent has been released.

Notes from the changelog:

<pre>
  * can now be invoked with a sub-command; will run until subcommand
    completes, and then terminate with the same return code (this is
    similar to the ssh-agent technique, and enables inclusion in
    Xsession.d; see monkeysphere 0.29 package for automatic startup).
  * chooses arbitrary open port by default (can still be specified with
    MSVA_PORT environment variable)
  * minimized logging spew by default.
  * now shipping README.schema (notes about possible future MSVA
    implementations)
  * cleanup Makefile and distribution strategies.
</pre>
