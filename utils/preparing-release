### Notes about preparing a release for the monkeysphere ###

 * make sure that packaging/debian/changelog has a reasonable version
   number.

 * make tarball

 * make releasenote

 * create upstream version tag: 

    git tag -s -m 'Tagging Monkeysphere $whatever' monkeysphere_$whatever

 * create debian-specific version tag:

    git tag -s -m 'Tagging Monkeysphere $whatever-1' monkeysphere_$whatever-1
