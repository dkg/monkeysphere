### Notes about preparing a release for the monkeysphere ###

 * make sure that packaging/debian/changelog has a reasonable version
   number.

 * make tarball

 * make releasenote

 * commit outstanding changes.

 * create upstream version tag: 

    git tag -s -m 'Tagging Monkeysphere $whatever' monkeysphere_$whatever

 * run commands from make debian-package by hand (?) so that it
   doesn't trigger another tarball rebuild.  Make sure the package
   passes lintian checks, installs, upgrades, removes reasonably, etc.

 * debsign -k$GPGID *.changes

 * create debian-specific version tag:

    git tag -s -m 'Tagging Monkeysphere $whatever-1' monkeysphere_$whatever-1

 * update FreeBSD and Macports info:

    make freebsd-distinfo
    make macports-portsfile

   (probably should consider tagging these ports as well to make them
   easy to recover)

 * remember to add the new version (n + 1) to the bugtracker if it's
   not already:
