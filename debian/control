Description: use the OpenPGP web of trust to verify ssh connections
 SSH key-based authentication is tried-and-true, but it lacks a true
 Public Key Infrastructure for key certification, revocation and
 expiration.  MonkeySphere is a framework that uses the OpenPGP web of
 trust for these PKI functions.  It can be used in both directions:
 for users to get validated host keys, and for hosts to manage user
 permissions.
