monkeysphere (0.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Daniel Kahn Gillmor ]
  * openpgp2ssh now supports specifying keys by full fingerprint.

  [ Jameson Graef Rollins ]
  * Add AUTHORIZED_USER_IDS config variable for server, which defaults to
    %h/.config/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids, instead of
    /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids.
  * Remove {update,remove}-userids functions, since we decided they
    weren't useful enough to be worth maintaining.
  * Better handling of unknown users in server update-users
  * Add file locking when modifying known_hosts or authorized_keys
  * Better failure/prompting for gen-subkey
  * Add ability to set any owner trust level for keys in server keychain.
