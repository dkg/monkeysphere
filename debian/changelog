monkeysphere (0.8-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Daniel Kahn Gillmor ]
  * debian/control: switched Vcs-Git to use "centralized" git repo instead
    of my own.
  * More monkeysphere-server diagnostics
  * monkeysphere --gen-subkey now guesses what KeyID you meant.
  * added Recommends: ssh-askpass to ensure monkeysphere --gen-subkey works

  [ Jameson Graef Rollins ]
  * fix another bug for when ssh key files are missing.
  * sort processed keys so that "good" keys are processed after "bad"
    keys.  This will prevent malicious bad keys from causing good keys to
    be removed from key files.
  * enabled host key publication.
  * added checking of gpg.conf for keyserver
  * new functions to add/revoke host key user IDs
  * improved list-certifiers function (now non-priviledged)
