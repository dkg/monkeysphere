monkeysphere (0.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Daniel Kahn Gillmor ]
  * NOT YET RELEASED (switch to "experimental" when ready to release)

  [ Jameson Graef Rollins ]
  * Add AUTHORIZED_USER_IDS config variable for server, which defaults to
    %h/.config/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids, instead of
    /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids.
  * Remove {update,remove}-userids functions, since we decided they
    weren't useful enough to be worth maintaining.
