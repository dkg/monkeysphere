monkeysphere (0.16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Daniel Kahn Gillmor ]

    portability.

    getopt lives.

    re-run after they have been resolved.

    the tarball with: cd tests && ./basic

  [ Jameson Graef Rollins ]
  * Genericize fs location variables.

  * new functions to add/revoke host key user IDs
  * improved list-certifiers function (now non-privileged)
