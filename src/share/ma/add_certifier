# Monkeysphere authentication add-certifier subcommand
#
# This function adds a certifier whose signatures will be used to
# calculate validity of keys used to connect to user accounts on the
# server.  The specified certifier key is first retrieved from the Web
# of Trust with the monkeysphere-user-controlled gpg_sphere keyring.
# Once then new key is retrieved, it is imported into the core
# keyring.  The gpg_core then ltsigns the key with the desired trust
# level, and then the key is exported back to the gpg_sphere keyring.
# The gpg_sphere has ultimate owner trust of the core key, so the core
# ltsigs on the new certifier key can then be used by gpg_sphere
# calculate validity for keys inserted in the authorized_keys file.
#
# This is all to keep the monkeysphere user that connects to the
# keyservers from accessing the core secret key.
#
# The monkeysphere scripts are written by:
# Jameson Rollins <jrollins@finestructure.net>
# Jamie McClelland <jm@mayfirst.org>
# Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg@fifthhorseman.net>
