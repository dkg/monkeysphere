This will generate a revocation certificate for key $keyID
and dump the certificate to standard output.

It can also directly publish the new revocation certificate
to the public keyservers via $KEYSERVER if you want it to.

Publishing this certificate will IMMEDIATELY and PERMANENTLY revoke
your host key!

    # our current implementation is very simple: we just want to
    # generate the revocation certificate on stdout.  This provides
    # for the two most likely (but hopefully not common) scenarios:

    # an admin wants a revocation certificate for the host which they
    # can store securely offline.  In this case, the admin can
    # redirect stdout to a file, or can simply copy/paste or
    # transcribe from the terminal.

    # Alternately, an admin might want to publish the revocation
    # certificate immediately, which we can help them do as well.
