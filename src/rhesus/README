rhesus is the monkeysphere authorized_keys/known_hosts generator.

In authorized_keys mode, rhesus takes an auth_user_ids file, which
contains gpg user ids, uses gpg to fetch the keys of the specified
users, does a monkeysphere policy check on each id, and uses gpg2ssh
to generate authorized_keys lines for each verified id.  The lines are
then combined with a user's traditional authorized_keys file to create
a new authorized_keys file.

In known_hosts mode, rhesus takes an auth_host_ids file, which
contains gpg user ids of the form ssh://URL, uses gpg to fetch the
keys of the specified hosts, does a monkeysphere policy check on each
id, and uses gpg2ssh to generate a known_hosts lines for each verified
id.  The lines are then combined with a user's traditional known_hosts
file to create a new known_hosts file.

When run as a normal user, no special configuration is needed.

When run as an administrator to update system-maintained
authorized_keys files for each user, the following environment
variables should be defined first:

 MS_CONF=/etc/monkeysphere/monkeysphere.conf
 USER=foo

For example, the command might be run like this:

 for USER in $(ls -1 /home) ; do
   MS_CONF=/etc/monkeysphere/monkeysphere.conf rhesus --authorized_keys
 done
