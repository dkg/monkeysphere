rhesus is the monkeysphere authorized_keys generator.

It's goal is to take a user's auth_user_ids file, which contains gpg
user ids (and possibly authorized_keys options), use gpg to fetch the
keys of the specified users, do a monkeysphere policy check on each
id, and generate authorized_keys lines for verified id.
