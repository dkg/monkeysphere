# This is an sh-style shell configuration file.  Variable names should
# be separated from their assignements by a single '=' and no spaces.
# Environement variables with the same names as these variables but
# prefeced by "MONKEYSPHERE_" will take precedence over the values
# specified here.

# User who controls the monkeysphere authentication keyring.

# Log level.  Can be SILENT, ERROR, INFO, DEBUG, in increasing order
# of verbosity.
#LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Path to authorized_user_ids file to process to create
# authorized_keys file.  '%h' will be replaced by the home directory
# of the user, and %u will be replaced by the username of the user.
# For purely admin-controlled authorized_user_ids, you might put them
# in /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/%u
#AUTHORIZED_USER_IDS="%h/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids"

# Whether to add user controlled authorized_keys file to
# monkeysphere-generated authorized_keys file.  Should be path to file
# where '%h' will be replaced by the home directory of the user or
# '%u' by the username.  To not add any user-controlled file, put "-"
# FIXME: this usage of "-" contravenes the normal convention where "-"
# means standard in/out.  Why not use "none" or "" instead?
#RAW_AUTHORIZED_KEYS="%h/.ssh/authorized_keys"
