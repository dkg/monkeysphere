# Required key capabilities
# Must be quoted, lowercase, space-seperated list of the following:

#   c = certify
#   a = authentication

# check keyservers at every ssh connection:
# This overrides other environment variables (FIXME: what does this mean???)
# NOTE: setting CHECK_KEYSERVER to true will leak information about
