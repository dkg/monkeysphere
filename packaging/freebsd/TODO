This port is not ready yet. Upstream needs to change a few things (or we
need patches) to work around some dependencies, most notably:

 * lockfile-progs (they may use procmail's lockfile prog)
 * moreutils (for sponge)
 * an install target that also respects PREFIX

We also need to create the monkeysphere user in the pkg-install and
remove it in pkg-deinstall. To do this, this page has useful tips:

http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/porters-handbook/dads-uid-and-gids.html

and we'll have to copy scripts from existing ports that are suggested
above, see:

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/japanese/Wnn6/pkg-install
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/net/cvsup-mirror/pkg-install

or just look around the ports tree for pkg-install files, they are
usually for adding users.

There is also the usual crappy work involved with installing a .defaults
file instead of straight files in /usr/local/etc:

http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/porters-handbook/plist-config.html

Finally the pkg-plist needs to be checked. The package hasn't been
installed at all once yet, it only patches and builds.

The port is therefore marked as IGNORE, which makes it unusable, comment
out the IGNORE line in the Makefile to test.
