# /etc/X11/Xsession.d/70monkeysphere_use-validation-agent

# This is a script to be sourced by Xsession.  It wraps the session
# startup argument with a monkeysphere-validation-agent nested
# process, if available and none already exist.

# Enable this system-wide by setting
# MONKEYSPHERE_USE_VALIDATION_AGENT=true in
# /etc/monkeysphere/monkeysphere.conf

# Note that there is some weird interaction between this and
# dbus-session at the moment: dbus-launch can start the msva just
# fine, but if msva tries to start dbus-launch, dbus-launch fails
# with:

# Failed to waitpid() for babysitter intermediate process: No child processes

# So this is placed at position 70 -- *before* the dbus Xsession
# startup script, which is at 75 as of 2010-03-12, when i wrote this.

# this is also good, because it means that the MSVA will learn about
# the dbus session parameters, in case we want the agent to use dbus
# to communicate with the user.
