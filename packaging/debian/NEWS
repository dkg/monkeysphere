monkeysphere (0.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * There has been a major interface and data refactoring. Please see the
    man pages for details.  Major changes are listed here:
  * For end users: monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand is no more.
    its functionality has been folded into monkeysphere as a subcommand.
    So if you are currently using: 
     ssh -oProxyCommand='monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand %h %p'
    plese use instead:
     ssh -oProxyCommand='monkeysphere ssh-proxycommand %h %p'
  * For sysadmins: monkeysphere-server has been split into
    monkeysphere-host (for publishing the ssh host key of your machine)
    and monkeysphere-authentication (for setting up your machine to
    authenticate users via the OpenPGP Web of Trust)
  * For too-curious sysadmins: the layout of /var/lib/monkeysphere has
    changed dramatically.  If you did any tricky tweaking of the files in
    there, you probably want to check that your changes have been
    preserved after the upgrade.  The old files can be found in
    /var/lib/monkeysphere/backup-from-0.23-transition.
