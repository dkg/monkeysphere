  "The Golden Bezoar Release"

  * rearchitect UI:
    - replace monkeysphere-server with monkeysphere-{authentication,host}
    - fold monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand into /usr/bin/monkeysphere

  * new ability to import existing ssh host key into monkeysphere.  So now
    m-a import-key replaces m-s gen-key.

    material into OpenPGP keys (introduces new perl dependencies)
  * get rid of getopts dependency

    monkeysphere-host subcommands that need it.

monkeysphere (0.22-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
  [ Jameson Graef Rollins ]

    - added info log output when a new key is added to known_hosts file.
    - added some useful output to the ssh-proxycommand for "marginal"
      cases where keys are found for host but do not have full validity.
    - force ssh-keygen to read from stdin to get ssh key fingerprint.

  [ Daniel Kahn Gillmor ]

    - automatically output two copies of the host's public key: one
    standard ssh public key file, and the other a minimal OpenPGP key with
    just the latest valid self-sig.
    - debian/control: corrected alternate dependency from procfile to
    procmail (which provides /usr/bin/lockfile)
