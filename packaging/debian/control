Description: leverage the OpenPGP web of trust for SSH and TLS authentication
 SSH key-based authentication is tried-and-true, but it lacks a true
 Public Key Infrastructure for key certification, revocation and
 expiration.  Monkeysphere is a framework that uses the OpenPGP web of
 trust for these PKI functions.  It can be used in both directions:
 for users to get validated host keys, and for hosts to authenticate
 users.  Current monkeysphere SSH tools are designed to integrate
 with the OpenSSH implementation of the Secure Shell protocol.
 . 
 Monkeysphere can also be used by a validation agent to validate TLS
 connections (e.g. https).
