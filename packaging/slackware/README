Monkeysphere on Slackware
=========================

Silvio Rhatto has written a SlackBuild script for the monkeysphere.

You can find the SlackBuild here:

  http://slack.sarava.org/slackbuilds/net/misc/monkeysphere/

This SlackBuild script is generated from a .mkbuild script, published
separately:

  http://slack.sarava.org/mkbuilds/net/misc/monkeysphere/

You can read more about the mkbuild system here:

Thanks, rhatto!
