Monkeysphere on Slackware
=========================

Silvio Rhatto wrote a SlackBuild script for the monkeysphere, which
was found here:

  https://slack.sarava.org/slackbuilds/net/misc/monkeysphere/

As of January 2019, it appears to be no longer online, but a copy can
be found at:

History
-------

This SlackBuild script was generated from a .mkbuild script, published
separately:

Thanks, rhatto!
