Monkeysphere User README
========================

As a regular user on a system where the monkeysphere package is
installed, you probably want to do a few things:

Keeping your keyring up-to-date
-------------------------------

Regularly refresh your GnuPG keyring from the keyservers.  This can be
done with a simple cronjob.

FIXME: give an example of a useful cronjob


Keeping your known_hosts file in sync with your keyring
-------------------------------------------------------

With your keyring updated, you want to make sure that openssh can
still see the most recent trusted information about who the various
hosts are:

$ monkeysphere update-known_hosts


Using monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand(1)
--------------------------------------

FIXME: make a suggestion about how to integrate this in daily use.


Setting up an OpenPGP authentication key
----------------------------------------

First things first: you'll need to create a new subkey for your
current key, if you don't already have one.  If your OpenPGP key is
keyid $GPGID, you can set up such a subkey relatively easily with:

$ monkeysphere gen-subkey $GPGID

Using your OpenPGP authentication key for SSH
---------------------------------------------

FIXME: Sending the key to the ssh-agent?

FIXME: using the key with a single session?

NOTE: the current version of openpgp2ssh does *not* deal well with
encrypted keys (as of 2008-07-26)

Miscellaneous
-------------

For a user to update their monkeysphere authorized_keys file:

$ monkeysphere update-authorized_keys

FIXME: where is this file located?  What does this command do?
