Monkeysphere README
===================

user usage
----------
For a user to update their known_hosts file:

$ monkeysphere update-known_hosts

For a user to update their monkeysphere authorized_keys file:

$ monkeysphere update-authorized_keys

server service publication
--------------------------
To publish a server host key:

# monkeysphere-server gen-key
# monkeysphere-server publish-key

This will generate the key for server with the service URI
(ssh://server.hostname).  The server admin should now sign the server
key so that people in the admin's web of trust can authenticate the
server without manual host key checking:

$ gpg --search ='ssh://server.hostname'
$ gpg --sign-key 'ssh://server.hostname'

server authorized_keys maintenance
----------------------------------
A system can maintain monkeysphere authorized_keys files for it's
users.

For each user account on the server, the userids of people authorized
to log into that account would be placed in:

/etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/USER

However, in order for users to become authenticated, the server must
determine that the user keys have "full" validity.  This means that
the server must fully trust at least one person whose signature on the
connecting users key would validate the user.  This would generally be
the server admin.  If the server admin's keyid is XXXXXXXX, then on
the server run:

# monkeysphere-server trust-keys XXXXXXXX

To update the monkeysphere authorized_keys file for user "bob", the
system would then run the following:

# monkeysphere-server update-users bob

To update the monkeysphere authorized_keys file for all users on the
the system, run the same command with no arguments:

# monkeysphere-server update-users
