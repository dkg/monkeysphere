Monkeysphere User README
========================

As a regular user on a system where the monkeysphere package is
installed, you probably want to do a few things:

Keeping your keyring up-to-date
-------------------------------

Regularly refresh your GnuPG keyring from the keyservers.  This can be
done with a simple cronjob.

FIXME: give an example of a useful cronjob


Keeping your known_hosts file in sync with your keyring
-------------------------------------------------------

With your keyring updated, you want to make sure that openssh can
still see the most recent trusted information about who the various
hosts are:

$ monkeysphere update-known_hosts


Using monkeysphere-ssh-proxycommand(1)
--------------------------------------

FIXME: make a suggestion about how to integrate this in daily use.


Miscellaneous
-------------

For a user to update their monkeysphere authorized_keys file:

$ monkeysphere update-authorized_keys

FIXME: where is this file located?  What does this command do?
