THE MONKEYSPHERE
================

AGENDA
======
[x] clowning
[ ] work
[x] jrollins will talk and gesture - in progress

MONKEYNAMES
===========

rhesus, marmoset, howler, langur, tamarin, barbary

COMPONENTS
==========

(names in "" are code names until we think of better ones.)

common components
-----------------
* "rhesus": update known_hosts/authorized_keys files:
  - be responsible for removing keys from the file as key revocation
    happens
  - be responsible for updating a key in the file where there is a key
    replacement
  - must result in a file that is parsable by the existing ssh client
    without errors
  - manual management must be allowed without stomping on it
  - provide a simple, intelligible, clear policy for key acceptance

* "langur": policy-editor for viewing/editing policies

* gpg2ssh: utility to convert gpg keys to ssh
  known_hosts/authorized_keys lines

* ssh2gpg: create openpgp keypair from ssh keypair

server-side components
----------------------
* "howler": server gpg maintainer
  - generate gpg keys for the server
  - publish server gpg keys
  - give owner trust to keys for user authentication

* "tamarin": concept - how to trigger or schedule rhesus at admin defined 
	points (e.g. via cron or during ssh connections).

client-side components
----------------------
* "marmoset": concept - how to trigger rhesus during attempt to initiate
  connection to server
  - runs on connection to a certain host
  - triggers update to known_hosts file then makes connection
  - proxy-command | pre-hook script | wrapper script
  - (ssh_config "LocalCommand" is only run *after* connection)

USE CASE
========

Dramatis Personae: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob
Backstory: http://www.conceptlabs.co.uk/alicebob.html

Bob wants to sign on to the computer "mangabey.example.org" via
monkeysphere framework.  He doesn't yet have access to the machine,
but he knows Alice, who is the admin of mangabey.  Alice and Bob,
being the conscientious netizens that they are, have already published
their personal gpg keys to the web of trust, and being good friends,
have both signed each other's keys and marked each others keys with
"full" ownertrust.

When Alice set up mangabey initially, she used howler to publish a gpg
key for the machine with the special userid of
"ssh://mangabey.example.org".  She also signed mangabey's gpg key and
published this certification to commonly-used keyservers.  Alice also
configured mangabey to treat her own key with full ownertrust (could
this be done as part of the howler invocation?)

Now, Alice creates a user account "bob" on mangabey, and puts Bob's
userid ("Bob <bob@example.org>") in the authorized_user_ids file for
user bob on mangabey.  tamarin triggers on mangabey either by a
cronjob or an inotify hook, and invokes rhesus for the "bob" account.
rhesus automatically takes each userid in bob's authorized_user_ids
file, and looks on a keyserver to find all public keys associated with
that user ID, with the goal of populating the authorized_keys file for
bob@mangabey.  

In particular: for each key found, the server evaluates the calculated
validity of the specified user ID based on the ownertrust rules it has
configured ("trust alice's certifications fully", in this example).
For each key for which the user ID in question is fully-valid, it
extracts all DSA- or RSA-based primary or secondary keys marked with
usage flags for encrypted communications and authentication, and
converts these gpg public keys into ssh public keys.  Finally, rhesus
inserts these calculated public keys into the authorized_keys file for
bob.

Bob now attempts to connect, by firing up a terminal and invoking:
"ssh bob@mangabey.example.org".  Bob's monkeysphere-enabled ssh client
notices that mangabey.example.org isn't already available in bob's
known_hosts file, and triggers rhesus (on Bob's computer) to fetch the
key for mangabey, with the goal of populating Bob's local known_hosts
file.

In particular: rhesus queries its configured keyservers to find all
public keys with User ID ssh://mangabey.example.org.  For each public
key found, rhesus checks the relevant User ID's validity, converts any
"encrypted comms, authentication" gpg public keys into ssh public keys
if the User ID validity is acceptable, and finally insert those keys
into Bob's known_hosts file.

On Bob's side, since mangabey's key had "full" validity (it was signed
by Alice whom he fully trusts), Bob's ssh client deems mangabey
"known" and no further host key checking is required.

On mangabey's side, since Bob's key has "full" validity (it had been
signed by Alice, mangabey's trusted administrator), Bob is
authenticated and therefore authorized to log into his account.

NOTES
=====

* Daniel and Elliot lie. <check>
* We will use a distributed VCS, each developer will create their own
  git repository and publish it publicly for others to pull from, mail
  out 
* public project page doesn't perhaps make sense yet
* approximate goal - using the web of trust to authenticate ppl for
  SSH 
* outline of various components of monkeysphere
* M: what does it mean to be in the monkeysphere?  not necessarily a
  great coder.
* J: interested in seeing project happen, not in actually doing it.
  anybody can contribute as much as they want. 
* J: if we put the structure in place to work on monkeysphere then we
  don't have to do anything 
* D: we are not creating 
* understand gpg's keyring better, understanding tools better,
  building scripts 
* Some debian packages allow automated configuration of config files.

* GENERAL GOAL - use openpgp web-of-trust to authenticate ppl for SSH
* SPECIFIC GOAL - allow openssh to tie into pgp web-of-trust without
  modifying either openpgp and openssh 
* DESIGN GOALS - authentication, use the existing generic OpenSSH
  client, the admin can make it default, although end-user should be
  decide to use monkeysphere or not 
* DESIGN GOAL - use of monkeysphere should not radically change
  connecting-to-server experience 
* GOAL - pick a monkey-related name for each component 

Host identity piece of monkeysphere could be used without buying into
the authorization component.

Monkeysphere is authentication layer that allows the sysadmin to
perform authorization on user identities instead of on keys, it
additionally allows the sysadmin also to authenticate the server to
the end-user.

see doc/git-init for more detail on how to pull from the distributed
repositories.
