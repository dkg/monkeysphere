2008-10-29 - dkg
	* aptitude update && aptitude full-upgrade
	* brought monkeysphere up to 0.19-1
	* removed tasksel
	
2008-10-25 - dkg
	* aptitude update && aptitude full-upgrade
	* brought monkeysphere up to 0.16-1
	* repointed keyserver usage to pool.sks-keyservers.net
	
2008-09-04 - dkg
	* added two mime-type declarations in /etc/mathopd.conf so .debs
	  and .tar.gz files come out reasonably; restarted mathopd for the
	  re-read.
	* built monkeyshell (from src/monkeyshell) and installed as
	  /usr/local/bin/monkeyshell, added to /etc/shells.
	* created new account "monkey" which has monkeyshell as the shell
	  for non-privileged test access.  To let someone test this out,
	  make sure they're well-connected to george's web of trust, and
	  then add their User ID to
	  ~monkey/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids
	* more mime types for mathopd: image/png image/x-icon
	
2008-09-03 - micah
	* migrated /home/*/.config/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids to new
	agreed location: /home/*/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids and created
	a symlink in the original location for transition purposes. Also,
	did /root's as well. I used this hackish mechanism:
	$ for user in `find . -wholename './*/.config/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids' \
	| cut -d/ -f2`; do mkdir -v ${user}/.monkeysphere; chown ${user}:${user} \
	${user}/.monkeysphere; mv -v ${user}/.config/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids \
	${user}/.monkeysphere; ln -s /home/${user}/.monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids \
	${user}/.config/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids; done

	   - dkg
	* added the monkeysphere archive repository signing key
	* aptitude update && aptitude full-upgrade (brings in monkeysphere 0.13-1)
	* cleaned up /etc/skel to reflect correct location of the
	  monkeysphere config directory.
	* micah moved all the existing config stuff over, and left
	  symlinks so people aren't disoriented.
	
2008-09-01 - dkg

	  george, using runit. (root-served repos are served from

	/etc/default/ssh to have 'unset SSHD_OOM_ADJUST' instead.
	
2008-06-20 - micah
	* Commented out the 'export SSHD_OOM_ADJUST=-17' from the
	/etc/init.d/ssh initscript, and the 'SSHD_OOM_ADJUST=-17' from
	/etc/default/ssh in order to make this error go away:
	"error writing /proc/self/oom_adj: Operation not permitted"
	(c.f. Debian #487325)
	
2008-06-20 - dkg

	bloat!

	* installed strace to try to figure out why onak is segfaulting.

	* added mathopd onak, tweaked /etc/mathopd.conf and /etc/onak.conf

	* configured authorized_user_ids for every user account based on
	my best guess at their OpenPGP User ID (see
