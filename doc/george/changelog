2008-06-19 - dkg
	* installed rsync (for maintaining a public apt repo)
	
	* configured mathopd to listen on port 80, serving /srv/www as /
	and /srv/apt as /debian.  We've got nothing in /srv/www at the
	moment, though.
	
2008-06-19 - dkg
	* removed etch sources, switched "testing" to "lenny", added
	lenny/updates, removed all contrib and non-free.
	
	* removed testing pin in /etc/apt/preferences
	* ran the upgrade
	
	* reset emacs22 to emacs22-nox (avoiding dependencies)
	
	* removed sysklog and klogd because of errors restarting klogd.
	Installed syslog-ng in their stead, which still gives errors
	related to /proc/kmsg unreadability, but the install completes :/
	
	* added experimental
	* juggled pinning: experimental: 1, unstable: 2	
	* added mathopd onak, tweaked /etc/mathopd.conf and /etc/onak.conf
	
	* installed monkeysphere v0.1-1, changed host key, published
	them via the local keyserver (see host-key-publication)

	* added local unprivileged user accounts for everyone listed in
	/usr/share/doc/monkeysphere/copyright

	* configured authorized_user_ids for every user account based on
	my best guess at their OpenPGP User ID (see
	user-id-configuration).

	* set up a cronjob (in /etc/crontab) to run "monkeysphere-server
	update-users" at 26 minutes past the hour.
	
2008-06-18 - jrollins
	* installed less, emacs;
	* aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade

2008-06-18 - micah
	* debootstrap'd debian etch install
	* installed /etc/apt/sources.list with local proxy sources for etch,
	  testing, unstable, backports and volatile
	* configured /etc/apt/preferences and apt.conf.d/local-conf to
	  pin etch, but make testing, sid and backports available
	* added backports.org apt-key
	* installed openssh-server and openssh-client packages
	* added dkg, jrollins, mjgoins ssh public_keys to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
