setting up authorized_user_id configuration on george was also more
cumbersome than it needs to be.  Here's what i (dkg) did:

monkeysphere-server trust-keys 0EE5BE979282D80B9F7540F1CCD2ED94D21739E9

monkeysphere-server update-user-userids dkg 'Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg@fifthhorseman.net>'
monkeysphere-server update-user-userids jrollins 'Jameson Rollins <jrollins@fifthhorseman.net>'
monkeysphere-server update-user-userids micah 'Micah Anderson <micah@riseup.net>' 
monkeysphere-server update-user-userids mjgoins 'Matthew Goins <mjgoins@openflows.com>'
monkeysphere-server update-user-userids ross 'Ross Glover <ross@ross.mayfirst.org>'
monkeysphere-server update-user-userids jamie 'Jamie McClelland <jamie@mayfirst.org>'
monkeysphere-server update-user-userids mlcastle 'mike castleman <m@mlcastle.net>'
monkeysphere-server update-user-userids enw 'Elliot Winard <enw@caveteen.com>'
monkeysphere-server update-user-userids greg 'Greg Lyle <greg@stealthisemail.com>' 


then i added a scheduled:

  monkeysphere-server update-users

to run hourly via /etc/crontab

and made sure that root's keys were working with a temporary symlink
(see TODO about that business)

and then modified /etc/ssh/sshd_config with:

 AuthorizedKeysFile      /var/cache/monkeysphere/authorized_keys/%u


Some outstanding questions:

 * Should we ship a scheduled monkeysphere-server update-users cron
   job automatically?

 * why was i not prompted to confirm the trust-keys line, which seems
   like the most delicate/sensitive line of all of them?
