setting up authorized_user_id configuration on george was also more
cumbersome than it needs to be.  Here's what i (dkg) did:

 GNUPGHOME=/etc/monkeysphere/gnupg gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --search dkg@fifthhorseman.net
 GNUPGHOME=/etc/monkeysphere/gnupg gpg --fingerprint dkg@fifthhorseman.net

set up the authorized_user_ids (why are these in /etc/ and not in
people's home directories?)

echo 'Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg@fifthhorseman.net>' > /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/dkg
echo 'Jameson Rollins <jrollins@fifthhorseman.net>' > /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/jrollins
echo 'Micah Anderson <micah@riseup.net>' > /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/micah
echo 'Matthew Goins <mjgoins@openflows.com>' > /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/mjgoins
echo 'Ross Glover <ross@ross.mayfirst.org>' > /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/ross
echo 'Jamie McClelland <jamie@mayfirst.org>' > /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/jamie
echo 'mike castleman <m@mlcastle.net>' > /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/mlcastle
echo 'Elliot Winard <enw@caveteen.com>' > /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/enw
echo 'Greg Lyle <greg@stealthisemail.com>' > /etc/monkeysphere/authorized_user_ids/greg
