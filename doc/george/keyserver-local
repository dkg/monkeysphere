On Saturday (2008-6-22) dkg and I set up sks as a replacement for onak. onak
had proven to be unstable, mostly in that it tended to corrupt its own database
beyond repair. 

The sks instructions want the admin to download many huge dumps of keys from
the world's keyservers (on the order of 5 GiB?), so we imported a dump
containing only my key. We learned that sks won't start with an empty database,
unlike onak.

2008-06-25: Locally exported george's key to its keyserver. Tried a remote
send-keys of squash's key and it appears to work.


TODO:
 
 * Get some more keys in there.

 * Read up on syncing with other keyservers.
