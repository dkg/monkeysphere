Next-Steps Monkeysphere Projects:
---------------------------------

Detail advantages of monkeysphere: detail the race conditions in ssh,
   and how the monkeysphere can help you reduce these threat vectors:
   threat model reduction diagrams 

Determine how openssh handles multiple processes writing to
   known_hosts file (atomic appends?)

Handle unknown hosts in such a way that they're not always removed
   from known_hosts file.  Ask user to lsign the host key?

Handle multiple multiple hostnames (multiple user IDs?) when
   generating host keys with gen-key.

Make sure alternate ports are handled for known_hosts.

Add environment variables sections to man pages.

Script to import private key into ssh agent.

Provide a friendly interactive UI for marginal or failing client-side
   hostkey verifications.  Handle the common cases smoothly, and
   provide good debugging info for the unusual cases.

Make sure onak properly escapes user IDs with colons in them.

Build a decent, presentable web site for documentation, evangelism,
   etc.  Include a mention of how to report trouble or concerns.

Create ssh2openpgp or convert to full-fledged keytrans.

Resolve the bugs listed in openpgp2ssh(1):BUGS.

Understand and document alternate trustdb models.

Understand and document the output of gpg --check-trustdb:
 gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model
 gpg: depth: 0  valid:   2  signed:  20  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 2u
 gpg: depth: 1  valid:  20  signed:  67  trust: 15-, 0q, 1n, 3m, 1f, 0u
 gpg: next trustdb check due at 2008-10-09

Understand and document the numeric values between sig! and the keyid
   in "gpg --check-sigs $KEYID" .  Compare with the details found from
   "gpg --with-colons --check-sigs $KEYID".  This has to do with trust
   signatures.

Fix gpg's documentation to clarify the difference between validity and
   ownertrust.  Include better documentation for trust signatures.

Make it easier to do domain-relative ssh host trust signatures with
   gnupg. (e.g. "i trust Jamie McClelland (keyID 76CC057D) to properly
   identify ssh servers in the mayfirst.org domain") See:
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.3.21 and grep for
   "tsign" in gpg(1).

Fix the order of questions when user does a tsign in gpg or gpg2.
