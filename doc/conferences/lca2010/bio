Daniel Kahn Gillmor (dkg) is a freelance Technology Advisor with a
particular interest in cryptography, user interface design, and
distributed systems as means to pursue the goals of user autonomy and
resistance to centralized control.  He contributes discussion and
patches on several crypto-related lists, and is an active participant
in what remains of the IETF OpenPGP Working Group.  He co-administers
one of the OpenPGP keyservers, and was dubiously involved in
publicizing the ongoing transition to a post-SHA1 Web of Trust.

dkg works with schools, NGOs, activist groups, and some corporations
to help them understand their tech needs and risks, possible
solutions, and how to use and understand the tools they choose.  He
works with several technology-focused organizations, including May
First/People Link (http://mayfirst.org/) and Riseup
(http://riseup.net).

He is also a contributor to The Organic Internet
(http://mayfirst.org/organicinternet), which includes his essay about
structural flaws in the X.509 certificate model.

dkg began working with free software in 2002, and became a Debian
Developer in 2009.  The Monkeysphere project began to coalesce in
early 2008, and remains an ongoing collaboration of many people,
