<h1>Monkeysphere: an OpenPGP-based PKI for SSH</h1>

<p>Ever thought that there should be an automated way to handle ssh
keys?  Do you know the administrators of your servers, and wish that
SSH could verify new host keys from them automatically, based on your
personal connections to the web-of-trust?  Do you wish you could
revoke and rotate your old SSH authentication keys without having to
log into every single machine?</p>

<p>Do you administer servers, and wish you could re-key them without
sowing massive pain and confusion among your users (or worse,
encouraging bad security habits among them)?  Do you wish you could
identify the users to grant access by name, instead of by opaque
string?  Do you wish you could rapidly grant or revoke access to a
user across a group of machines by enabling or disabling
authentication for that user?</p>

<p>A group of us have been working on a public key infrastructure for
SSH. <a href="http://monkeysphere.info">Monkeysphere</a> makes use of
the existing OpenPGP web-of-trust to fetch and cryptographically
validate (and revoke!) keys.  This works in either directions: both
<code>authorized_keys</code> <em>and</em> <code>known_hosts</code> are
handled.  Monkeysphere gives users and admins tools to deal with SSH
keys by thinking about the people and machines to whom the keys
belong, instead of requiring humans to do tedious (and error-prone)
manual key verification.</p>

<p>We have <a href="http://monkeysphere.info/download">debian packages
available</a> which should install against lenny, <a
href="https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/monkeysphere">a mailing
list</a>, and open ears for good questions, suggestions and
criticism.</p>

<p>If you have a chance to give it a try (<a href="???">as a user</a>
or <a href="???">as an admin</a>), it would be great to <a
href="https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/monkeysphere">get
feedback</a>.</p>
